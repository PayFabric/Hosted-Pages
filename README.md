PayFabric Hosted Pages
======================
PayFabric hosted pages are secure pages that can be embedded into your application, to allow for processing of the transactions or creating new credit card or eCheck entries into a customerâ€™s wallet. Below are the base URLs:

1. Live Server:    ``https://www.payfabric.com/V2/Web``
1. Sandbox Server: ``https://sandbox.payfabric.com/V2/Web``

We have a [detailed guide](Sections/PaymentPage.md) for getting started with embedding the payment page into your application.

The wallet page is used for embedding a page to create or modify credit card or eCheck entries.

Customize Page
--------------

Both the payment and wallet pages are able to be customized with a custom theme consisting of custom CSS and JavaScript, which will be inserted into and applied to the hosted pages.
