Hosted Payment Page
===================

The PayFabric hosted payment page is used for embedding the payment page into your application to allow your users to process a transaction.

Before embedding the payment page, please ensure the following:

1. Generate a [Security Token](/Sections/Security%20Token.md).  Assume the token value is @TOKEN.
2. Generate a new transaction, see our [API documentation](../../../../PayFabric-APIs/blob/master/PayFabric/Sections/Transactions.md#create-a-transaction) for how.  Assume the transaction key is @TRXKEY.

**Note**: Hosted Payment Page will NOT load a _Verify_ transaction.
 
Build the payment hosted page URL this way:

https://sandbox.payfabric.com/Payment/Web/Transaction/Process?key={@TRXKEY}&token={@TOKEN}
